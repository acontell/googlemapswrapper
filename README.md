# Google Maps Wrapper

This project aims to improve the usability of google maps. Make it easier to use. The idea is to wrap some of the google maps functionality in easy-to-use functions.

# Tested functionality

Now, we are able to create an array of markers and print them out on screen from an array of objects.
Some parsing of the array of objects might be necessary to adapt it to the gmaps library requirements.
For instance, every object must have a position property which depicts the position of the marker.
